# 15-puzzle-python
15 Puzzle simulator in Python 3.5 using Pygame I wrote in 2016. It is very basic and does not have a scrambler or timer,
but it is functional.

To run the file, make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then either double-click the file and click run, or navigate to the directory the file is in and type "python 15puzzle.py".

Have fun!
